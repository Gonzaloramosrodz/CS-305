Artifact: Artemis Financial Vulnerability Assessment Report
Client Summary

The client for this project was Artemis Financial, a company specializing in financial services. They required a security assessment of their software systems to identify vulnerabilities and recommend mitigations. The goal was to help Artemis Financial protect sensitive client information, prevent breaches, and comply with industry security standards.
Software Vulnerabilities and Secure Coding

In performing the vulnerability assessment, I thoroughly reviewed the software’s source code and system configuration. I was able to identify critical security flaws, such as improper input validation and insecure data handling practices. Identifying these vulnerabilities accurately demonstrated my ability to apply secure coding principles. Secure coding is vital because it protects against potential attacks and ensures client data is not exposed, maintaining the company's reputation and financial stability.
Challenges and Helpful Aspects

One challenging aspect of the assessment was prioritizing vulnerabilities based on severity and potential business impact. However, this also helped me develop a better understanding of real-world risk management. Learning how to focus on the most critical issues first was an especially valuable takeaway.
Security Layers and Future Improvements

To strengthen the software’s defenses, I recommended multiple layers of security controls, including input validation, proper authentication methods, and data encryption. In future assessments, I would use automated vulnerability scanners, like OWASP ZAP or Burp Suite, alongside manual code reviews to ensure comprehensive coverage and faster identification of risks.
Ensuring Functionality and Security

After suggesting code changes (refactoring), I focused on ensuring the software’s functionality remained intact by reviewing unit tests and conducting manual testing of key features. I also re-ran security scans after changes to verify that no new vulnerabilities were introduced as a result of the fixes.
Tools, Resources, and Best Practices

During the assessment, I relied on the OWASP Top Ten framework, secure coding guidelines, and common cybersecurity tools like code linters and static analysis tools. These resources are essential for ensuring code quality and will be helpful in future development and testing tasks.
Showing Future Employers

For future employers, this assignment showcases my ability to perform a detailed security vulnerability assessment, communicate findings clearly, and suggest actionable security improvements. It demonstrates both technical skills and a mindset focused on building secure and reliable software systems.
